# library-dao
directory contains a PDF on how to work with C# DAO and accompanying code

We work with a library database that contains a single table of books. The data of the books includes title, author, and publication date.

Using ADO.NET, we implement a framework to communicate with that database via C#. The program contains methods to retrieve a list of all books in our library our a single book based on the ID of the book. Other methods include adding a new book to the library database, modifying existing books, or removing a book from the database.

The PDF file explains the methods found in the program in greater detail. In addition, it gives further information on what the DAO pattern is and how to use it with ADO.NET.
